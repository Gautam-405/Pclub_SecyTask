<h1>Project Title: Pingala Timetable Extractor</h1>
This Chrome extension extracts timetable data from the Pingala website, shows the timetable in its preview, notifies the user before each class, and displays additional relevant information. It comprises six core files, each of which performs a specific role in the extension's functionality.

Files
1. manifest.json
This is the metadata file in JSON format that contains properties like your extension's name, description, version number and so on. In essence, it explains what the extension is going to do, and what permissions it requires.

2. content.js
This is the content script, which has access to the current page and can manipulate its DOM. This script extracts the timetable and additional information from the Pingala website.

3. popup.html
This is the HTML file for the popup displayed when users click on the extension icon in the toolbar. It provides the user interface where the timetable and additional information are displayed.

4. popup.js
This is the JavaScript file for the popup. It handles interactions with the popup's HTML elements, such as responding to button clicks. This script retrieves the timetable and additional information from storage and updates the popup's UI accordingly.

5. styles.css
This is the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file for the popup. It handles all the styling aspects of the popup, making the user interface visually appealing and user-friendly.
